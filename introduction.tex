\section{Introduction}

By 2015, the annual global production of plastics surpassed 367 million tonnes; \SI{55}{\percent} of all plastic waste was discarded, \SI{25.5}{\percent} incinerated and just \SI{19.5}{\percent} was recycled \cite{Geyer2017}. \iupac{Poly|(ethylene terephthalate)} (PET) is one of the most widely used thermoplastics in the packaging and textile industry; due to its increasing overconsumption and non-biodegradablity, it has become a serious environmental problem. 
Over the last decades, there have been numerous studies on the topic of polymer recycling; by far, the most acceptable method according to the principles of \emph{sustainable development} is the tertiary recycling, commonly referred as \emph{chemical recycling,} because it forms \latin{de novo} the monomer(s) involved on the production of the polymer itself or derivatives thereof \cite{Bartolome2012}.

For the chemical recycling of PET, numerous protocols involving hydrolysis, methanolysis and glycolysis among many others \cite{Campanelli1993,Campanelli1994,Campanelli1994a} have been reported. The uncatalyzed glycolysis of PET is not an effective process; transition metal (TM) salts have been determined to aid in this reaction. The oldest report of the catalyzed glycolytic degradation of PET was reported by \citeauthor{Vaidya1988} in \citeyear{Vaidya1988} \cite{Vaidya1988} in which they carried the reaction using different metal acetates as catalysts. Then it was determined that \ch{Zn^{II}} has a great in comparison to other TM (\ch{Mn^{II}}, \ch{Co^{II}} and \ch{Pb^{II}}) activity as a catalyst in the glycolysis of PET \cite{Ghaemy2005}. Alongside the numerous zinc catalysts studied to date, a novel zinc complex made with a polyaza macroligand, \iupac{\N^1,\N^2-bis|(2-amino|benzyl)|-1,2-|diamino|ethane zinc(II)} (ABEN) \cite{Elizondo-Martinez2013} has shown to have a great catalytic activity in the glycolytic degradation of PET \cite{Ovalle-Sanchez2017}. The main purpose of this article is to evaluate the possible reaction mechanism involved in this catalyzed glycolytic depolymerization of PET with ABEN and determine the covalent or non-covalent interactions involved.
