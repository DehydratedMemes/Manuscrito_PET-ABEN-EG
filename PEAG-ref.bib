The stability of the scintillator constituents was determined through fluorescence excitation emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy and absorption spectroscopy, using parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) as an multivariate analysis tool. By exposing the scintillator liquid to a well-known photon flux at 365 nm and by measuring the decay rate of the fluorescence shifters and the formation rate of their photochemical degradation products, we can place an upper limit on the acceptable photon flux as 1.38 {$\pm$} 0.09 \texttimes{} 10               -11               photon mol L               -1               . Similarly, the oxidative stability of the scintillator liquid was determined by exposure to air at several elevated temperatures. Through measurement of the corresponding activation energy it was determined that the average oxygen concentration would have to be kept below 4.3\textendash 7.1 ppb               w               (headspace partial pressure below 24 ppm               v               ). On the other hand, the thermal stability of the scintillator cocktail in the absence of light and oxygen was remarkable and poses no concern to the SNO+ experiment.},

  abstract = {The climbing image nudged elastic band method (CI-NEB) is used to identify reaction coordinates and to find saddle points representing transition states of reactions. It can make efficient use of parallel computing as the calculations of the discretization points, the so-called images, can be carried out simultaneously. In typical implementations, the images are distributed evenly along the path by connecting adjacent images with equally stiff springs. However, for systems with a high degree of flexibility, this can lead to poor resolution near the saddle point. By making the spring constants increase with energy, the resolution near the saddle point is improved. To assess the performance of this energy-weighted CI-NEB method, calculations are carried out for a benchmark set of 121 molecular reactions. The performance of the method is analyzed with respect to the input parameters. Energyweighted springs are found to greatly improve performance and result in successful location of the saddle points in less than a thousand energy and force evaluations on average (about a hundred per image) using the same set of parameter values for all of the reactions. Even better performance is obtained by stopping the calculation before full convergence and complete the saddle point search using an eigenvector following method starting from the location of the climbing image. This combination of methods, referred to as NEB-TS, turns out to be robust and highly efficient as it reduces the average number of energy and force evaluations down to a third, to 305. An efficient and flexible implementation of these methods has been made available in the ORCA software.},

The glycolyzed products consist mostly of the PET monomer, bis(hydroxyethyl) terephthalate, and the dimer, and after long reaction time (up to and longer than 8 h), an equilibrium is attained between these two species. No other higher PET oligomers were detected in the study. Of the four metal acetates (lead, zinc, cobalt, and manganese) tested, zinc acetate is the best in terms of the extent of depolymerization, that is, the relative amount of monomer formed. The presence of green pigment in one type of recycled PET apparently has no effects on the glycolysis reaction. Copyright \textcopyright{} 1989 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

For a given functional (except LSDA) Stuttgart-type quasi-relativistic effective core potentials and an all-electron scalar relativistic approach (ZORA) tend to produce very similar geometries. In contrast to the lighter congeners, LSDA affords reasonably accurate geometries of 5d-metal complexes, as it is among the functionals with the lowest mean and standard deviations from experiment. For this set the ranking of some other popular density functionals, ordered according to decreasing standard deviation, is BLYP {$>$} VSXC {$>$} BP86 {$\approx$} BPW91 {$\approx$} TPSS {$\approx$} B3LYP {$\approx$} PBE {$>$} TPSSh {$>$} B3PW91 {$\approx$} B3P86 {$\approx$} PBE hybrid. In this case hybrid functionals are superior to their nonhybrid variants. In addition, we have reinvestigated the previous test sets for 3d- (B\"uhl M.; Kabrede, H. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2006, 2, 1282-1290) and 4d- (Waller, M. P.; B\"uhl, M. J. Comput. Chem. 2007, 28,1531-1537) transition-metal complexes using all-electron scalar relativistic DFT calculations in addition to the published nonrelativistic and ECP results. For this combined test set comprising first-, second-, and third-row metal complexes, B3P86 and PBE hybrid are indicated to perform best. A remarkably consistent standard deviation of around 2 pm in metal-ligand bond distances is achieved over the entire set of d-block elements. \textcopyright{} 2008 American Chemical Society.},

When the calculated geometries were compared with the X-ray structure determination for the analogous complex with permethylated cyclopentadienyl, it was found that in all cases the coordination mode of the n3-allyl was very poorly described, despite the functional used. The Ru-C bond distance corresponding to the substituted alryl carbon was overestimated by 0.23-0.50 \AA, depending on the functional and the basis set used. These results were reproduced by further testing carried out with the ADF program and larger basis sets. MP2 leads to an acceptable value for the same Ru-C distance, with an underestimation of 0.07 \AA, suggesting that, at least in the case of the functionals tested, DFT does not provide an accurate description of a weak Ru-C interaction. \textcopyright{} 2007 American Chemical Society.},

  abstract = {In the present account factors determining the stability of ZnL, ZnL2, and ZnL3 complexes (L = bpy, 2,2{${'}$}-bipyridyl) were characterized on the basis of various techniques: the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM), energy decomposition schemes based on interacting quantum atoms (IQA), and extended transition state coupled with natural orbitals for chemical valence (ETSNOCV). Finally, the noncovalent interactions (NCI) index was also applied. All methods consistently indicated that the strength of the coordination bonds, Zn- O and Zn-N, decreases from ZnL to ZnL3. Importantly, it has been identified that the strength of secondary intramolecular heteropolar hydrogen bonding interactions, CH{$\cdot\cdot\cdot$}O and CH{$\cdot\cdot\cdot$}N, increases when going from ZnL to ZnL3. A similar trend appeared to be valid for the {$\pi$}-bonding as well as electrostatic stabilization. In addition to the above leading bonding contributions, all techniques suggested the existence of very subtle, but non-negligible additional stabilization from the CH{$\cdot\cdot\cdot$}HC electronic exchange channel; these interactions are the weakest among all considered here. From IQA it was found that the local diatomic interaction energy, EiHnt,H, amounts at HF to -2.5, -2.7, and -2.9 kcal mol-1 for ZnL, ZnL2, and ZnL3, respectively (-2.1 kcal mol-1 for ZnL at MP2). NOCV-based deformation density channels showed that formation of CH--HC contacts in Zn complexes causes significant polarization of {$\sigma$}(C-H) bonds, which accordingly leads to charge accumulation in the CH{$\cdot\cdot\cdot$}HC bay region. Charge depletion from {$\sigma$}(C-H) bonds was also reflected in the calculated spin-spin 1J(C-H) coupling constants, which decrease from 177.06 Hz (ZnL) to 173.87 Hz (ZnL3). This last result supports our findings of an increase in the local electronic CH{$\cdot\cdot\cdot$}HC stabilization from ZnL to ZnL3 found from QTAIM, IQA, and ETS-NOCV. Finally, this work unites for the first time the results from four methods that are widely used for description of chemical bonding.},

This gives the density of the crystals as 1.455 g/cm               3               . If it is assumed that the density of amorphous regions in partly crystalline material is the same as that of the entirely amorphous material (1.335), the proportion by weight of crystals in ordinary drawn yarn (density 1.39) is 48\%, and in specimens of the highest recorded density (1.41) it is 64.5\%. These figures are, however, lower limits; if, as is likely, the density of amorphous regions in partly crystalline specimens is lower than 1.335, the proportions of crystalline material are higher than the figures given. The positions of atoms in the crystals have been deduced from the relative intensities of X-ray diffractions; approximate positions were found by trial-and-error methods, and refinement was then effected by calculations of electron densities, using the three-dimensional Fourier synthesis method. The molecules are nearly planar in configuration. Distances between atoms in neighbouring molecules are all normal Van der Waals contact distances; there is therefore no structural evidence for any unusually strong forces between the molecules. This conclusion is in agreement with that based on an estimate of the cohesion energy, which is very nearly the same as that of a comparable aliphatic polyester, polyethylene adipate. The high melting-point of polyethylene terephthalate in comparison with aliphatic polyesters is therefore not due to strong forces between the molecules; it is attributed to the O\textemdash{} / rigidity of the aromatic ring with its attached \textemdash C groups. {$\setminus\setminus$} O In most drawn fibres of this polymer, the crystals do not have their c-axes (those parallel to the chain molecules) exactly parallel to the fibre axes; they are tilted in a precisely defined crystallographic direction, such that the 530 plane remains vertical and the inclination of the 001 plane to the fibre axis increases. This is especially well defined in fibres heated to 210\textdegree{} C and allowed to relax, the tilt angle being then about 5\textdegree. In principle it is expected that polymer crystals of triclinic symmetry would be tilted, but it is not clear what determines the crystallographic direction of tilt. Tilted crystal X-ray diffraction photographs played an important part in the structure determination.},

Methodological aspects of reference data generation, representation, and regression, as well as the question of how a data-driven model may be validated, are reviewed and critically discussed. A survey of applications to a variety of research questions in chemistry and materials science illustrates the rapid growth in the field.

  abstract = {Abstract                            Cutinases are promising agents for poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) bio-recycling because of their ability to produce the PET monomer terephthalic acid with high efficiency under mild reaction conditions. In this study, we found that the low-crystallinity PET (lcPET) hydrolysis activity of thermostable cutinase from               Thermobifida fusca               (TfCut2), was increased by the addition of cationic surfactant that attracts enzymes near the lcPET film surface via electrostatic interactions. This approach was applicable to the mutant TfCut2 G62A/F209A, which was designed based on a sequence comparison with PETase from               Ideonella sakaiensis               . As a result, the degradation rate of the mutant in the presence of cationic surfactant increased to 31\,{$\pm$}\,0.1 nmol min               -1               cm               -2               , 12.7 times higher than that of wild-type TfCut2 in the absence of surfactant. The long-duration reaction showed that lcPET film (200 {$\mu$}m) was 97\,{$\pm$}\,1.8\% within 30\,h, the fastest biodegradation rate of lcPET film thus far. We therefore believe that our approach would expand the possibility of enzyme utilization in industrial PET biodegradation.},

However, robust global information, particularly about their end-of-life fate, is lacking. By identifying and synthesizing dispersed data on production, use, and end-of-life management of polymer resins, synthetic fibers, and additives, we present the first global analysis of all mass-produced plastics ever manufactured. We estimate that 8300 million metric tons (Mt) as of virgin plastics have been produced to date. As of 2015, approximately 6300 Mt of plastic waste had been generated, around 9\% of which had been recycled, 12\% was incinerated, and 79\% was accumulated in landfills or the natural environment. If current production and waste management trends continue, roughly 12,000 Mt of plastic waste will be in landfills or in the natural environment by 2050.},

The glycolysis reactions were carried out at the boiling point of ethylene glycol under nitrogen atmosphere up to 10 h. Influences of the reaction time, volume of EG, catalysts and their concentrations on the yield of the glycolysis products were investigated. The glycolysis products were analysed for hydroxyl and acid values and identified by different techniques, such as HPLC, 1H NMR and 13C NMR, mass spectra, and DSC. It was found that the glycolysis products consist mainly of bis(hydroxyethyl)terephthalate [BHET] monomer ({$>$}75\%) which was effectively separated from dimer in quite pure crystalline form. \textcopyright{} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

We divide our discussion into self-contained sections, each discussing a specific method.

  abstract = {Mean-field electronic structure methods like Hartree-Fock, semilocal density functional approximations, or semiempirical molecular orbital (MO) theories do not account for long-range electron correlation (London dispersion interaction). Inclusion of these effects is mandatory for realistic calculations on large or condensed chemical systems and for various intramolecular phenomena (thermochemistry). This Review describes the recent developments (including some historical aspects) of dispersion corrections with an emphasis on methods that can be employed routinely with reasonable accuracy in large-scale applications. The most prominent correction schemes are classified into three groups: (i) nonlocal, density-based functionals, (ii) semiclassical C6-based, and (iii) one-electron effective potentials. The properties as well as pros and cons of these methods are critically discussed, and typical examples and benchmarks on molecular complexes and crystals are provided. Although there are some areas for further improvement (robustness, many-body and short-range effects), the situation regarding the overall accuracy is clear. Various approaches yield long-range dispersion energies with a typical relative error of 5\%. For many chemical problems, this accuracy is higher compared to that of the underlying mean-field method (i.e., a typical semilocal (hybrid) functional like B3LYP).},

  abstract = {We present a new implementation of a trust-region augmented Hessian approach (TRAH-SCF) for restricted and unrestricted Hartree\textendash Fock and Kohn\textendash Sham methods. With TRAH-SCF, convergence can always be achieved even with tight convergence thresholds, which requires just a modest number of iterations. Our convergence benchmark study and our illustrative applications focus on open-shell molecules, also antiferromagnetically coupled systems, for which it is notoriously complicated to converge the Roothaan\textendash Hall self-consistent field (SCF) equations. We compare the number of TRAH iterations to reach convergence with those of Pulay's original and Kollmar's (K) variants of the direct inversion of the iterative subspace (DIIS) method and also analyze the obtained SCF solutions. Often, TRAH-SCF finds a symmetrybroken solution with a lower energy than DIIS and KDIIS. For unrestricted calculations, this is accompanied by a larger spin contamination, i.e., larger deviation from the desired spin-restricted {$\langle$}S2{$\rangle$} expectation value. However, there are also rare cases in which DIIS finds a solution with a lower energy than KDIIS and TRAH. In rare cases, both TRAH-SCF and KDIIS may also converge to a non-aufbau solution. For those calculations, standard DIIS always diverges. For cases that converge smoothly with either method, TRAH usually needs more iterations to converge than DIIS and KDIIS because for every new set of orbitals, the level-shifted Newton\textendash Raphson equations are solved approximately and iteratively. In such cases, the total runtime of TRAH-SCF is still competitive with the DIIS-based approaches even if extended basis sets are employed, which is illustrated for a large hemocyanin model complex.},

The first-principles based virtual sampling of this space, for example, in search of novel molecules or materials which exhibit desirable properties, is therefore prohibitive for all but the smallest subsets and simplest properties. We review studies aimed at tackling this challenge using modern machine learning techniques based on (i) synthetic data, typically generated using quantum mechanics based methods, and (ii) model architectures inspired by quantum mechanics. Such Quantum mechanics based Machine Learning (QML) approaches combine the numerical efficiency of statistical surrogate models with an ab initio view on matter. They rigorously reflect the underlying physics in order to reach universality and transferability across CCS. While state-of-the-art approximations to quantum problems impose severe computational bottlenecks, recent QML based developments indicate the possibility of substantial acceleration without sacrificing the predictive power of quantum mechanics.},

  abstract = {Chemical recycling of plastics offers a green method to deal with plastic waste. In this review, we highlight the recent advances made by applying organocatalysts to chemically degrade polymers as a promising tool to reach a circular plastic economy.           ,                             Polymeric materials have been accumulating in the environment for decades as a result of the linear way of consuming plastics. Unfortunately, the current approaches followed to treat such a large amount of plastic waste, mainly involving physical recycling or pyrolysis, are not efficient enough. Recently, chemical degradation has emerged as a long-term strategy towards reaching completely sustainable cycles where plastics are polymerised, depolymerised, and then re-polymerised with minimal changes in their quantity or final properties. Organocatalysts, which are promising ``green'' substitutes for traditional organometallic complexes, are able to catalyse depolymerisation reactions yielding highly pure small molecules that are adequate for subsequent polymerisations or other uses. Moreover, by varying several reaction parameters (               e.g.               solvent, temperature, concentration, co-catalyst,               etc.               ), the depolymerisation products can be tuned in innumerable possibilities, which further evidences the versatility of depolymerisation. In this review, we highlight the recent advances made by applying organocatalysts, such as organic bases, organic acids, and ionic compounds, to chemically degrade the most commonly used commercial polymers. Indeed, organocatalysis is envisaged as a promising tool to reach a circular and environmentally friendly plastic economy.},

  abstract = {The covalent chemical bond is intimately linked to electron sharing between atoms. The recent independent gradient model (IGM) and its {$\delta$}g descriptor provide a way to quantify locally this electron density interpenetration from wavefunction calculations. Each bond has its own IGM-{$\delta$}gpair signature. The present work establishes for the first time a strong link between this bond signature and the physically grounded bond force constant concept. Analyzing a large set of compounds and bonds, the intrinsic bond strength index (IBSI) emerges from the IGM formulation. Our study shows that the IBSI does not belong to the class of conventional bond orders (like Mulliken, Wiberg, Mayer, delocalization index, or electron localization functionÓÉïELF), but is rather a new complementary index, related to the bond strength. A fundamental outcome of this research is a novel index allowing to range all two-center chemical bonds by their intrinsic strength in molecular situation. We believe that the IBSI is a powerful and robust tool for interpretation accessible to a wide community of chemists (organic, inorganic chemistry, including transition-metal complexes and reaction mechanisms).},

The Becke exchange and the Becke-Lee-Yang-Parr (B-LYP) exchange-correlation functionals yield a purely repulsive potential after counterpoise correction. The Dirac-Slater (D-S) functional gives minima which are too deep, at internuclear distances which are too short, particularly for He2 and Ne2.

In the simplest approach, the Hartree\textendash Fock method, the total molecular wavefunction C is approximated as a Slater determinant composed of occupied spin orbitals. To use these in practical calculations the spatial orbitals are approximated as a linear combination (a weighted sum) of basis functions. Electron correlation methods are also discussed. The main uses of the ab initio method are calculating molecular geometries, energies, vibrational frequencies, spectra, ionization potentials and electron affinities, and properties like dipole moments which are connected with electron distribution. These calculations find theoretical and practical applications, since, for example, enzyme\textendash substrate interactions depend on shapes and charge distributions, reaction equilibria and rates depend on energy differences, and spectroscopy plays an important role in identifying and understanding novel molecules. The visualization of calculated phenomena can be very important in interpreting results.},

In this work, we propose a novel definition of bond order, called Laplacian bond order (LBO), which is defined as a scaled integral of negative parts of Laplacian of electron density in fuzzy overlap space. Many remarkable features of LBO are exemplified by numerous structurally diverse molecules. It is shown that LBO has a direct correlation with the bond polarity, the bond dissociation energy and the bond vibrational frequency. The dissociation behavior of LBO of the N-N bond in N2 has been studied. Effects of the basis sets, theoretic methods and geometrical conformations on LBO have also been investigated. Through comparisons, we discussed in details similarities and discrepancies among LBO, Mayer bond order, natural localized molecular orbital bond order, fuzzy overlap population and electron density at bond critical points.},

Our analysis of all the internuclear distances reveals that standard DFT predicts systematically expanded structures. In contrast, all the methods accounting for dispersion give rise to more compact structures, removing the systematic overestimation of internuclear distances. The contracting effect of dispersion is general and also affects chemical bonds, thus reducing the general overestimation of bond lengths. The best overall performance is observed for wB97XD, which offers relatively small statistical errors when considering the overall structure as well as selected distances. Only for the coordination center geometry is the accuracy of wB97XD matched by standard functionals such as PBE and TPSS, whereas M06 and M06L are associated with larger errors. At the other end of the scale, B3LYP is seen to give the largest statistical errors in general, both when considering the complete structures and the geometries of the coordination centers alone. For the organic ligands, however, B3LYP performs clearly better than the other standard functionals although not as well as the functionals accounting for dispersion. Extending the basis sets is seen to improve the structures in particular of the coordination center, thus underlining the importance of using sufficiently flexible basis sets if highly accurate geometries are to be obtained. Similar conclusions to those obtained for the ruthenium catalysts can be drawn from comparisons of the X-ray crystal structures of 10 other organometallic complexes of relevance to homogeneous catalysis, covering first (Ti, Fe, Co, Ni), second (Zr, Mo, Rh, Pd) and third (W, Ir) row transition metals, with those of DFT. The latter analyses thus offer a first indication that the picture obtained for the ruthenium alkylidene complexes may be extended to other classes of relatively large transition metal complexes. \textcopyright{} 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

This review summarizes the current understanding of the nature and characteristics of the most commonly used structural and chemical descriptions of atomistic structures, highlighting the deep underlying connections between different frameworks and the ideas that lead to computationally efficient and universally applicable models. It emphasizes the link between properties, structures, their physical chemistry, and their mathematical description, provides examples of recent applications to a diverse set of chemical and materials science problems, and outlines the open questions and the most promising research directions in the field.},

The depolymerization processes was tested at 180, 190 and 210 \textdegree C, and two molar ratios of PET:TEG (1:1.3 and 1:2.6), the amount of catalyst used was fxed at 1\% in relation to PET, the best experiment of PET glycolysis was found at 190 \textdegree C during two hours in a mass relation PET:TEG 1:1.3. All products were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (IR), gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), the behavior of the reaction rate was studied for the best experiment by measuring the amount of degraded PET at different glycolysis time. The degradation of PET was favored with the use of ABEN, which accelerates the reaction, obtaining oligomers in the absence of an organic solvent or reaction medium, this is the most efcient catalyst found so far. The oligomers were obtained with molecular weight between 900 and 1500 g mol-1 depending on the reaction time, 60 min was the less time of the total glycolysis of PET. Also was found that the molecular weight of the oligomers increased along the glycolysis, due to the recombination with TEG and ethylene glycol produced in degradation.},

Advantages of the chemical recycling of PET, the theoretical basis of the ester bond cleavage, and a wide spectrum of degrading agents and final products are presented. Chemical processes applied in polymer recycling are divided into six groups: methanolysis, glycolysis, hydrolysis, ammonolysis, aminolysis, and other methods. Numerous possibilities for the utilization of waste PET as a very useful raw chemical material are described on the basis of literature. A comparison of chemical recycling methods is carried out. The following aspects were taken into consideration: (i) flexibility in utilizing a variety of waste types, (ii) conditions necessary for degradation including safety requirements, (iii) economic aspects, and (iv) product versatility. A total of 108 references including 46 patents are cited in this paper.},

  author = {Patterson, Joan Diana},
  year = {2007},
  month = apr,
  abstract = {A single-step, extrusion-based process to depolymerize poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) has been investigated. The depolymerization is effected by reacting ethylene glycol (EG) with the high molecular weight polymer (glycolysis). The ethylene glycol causes chain scission by attacking the ester linkages along the polymer backbone. The objective is to recover purified low molecular weight oligomers of bis(hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) for repolymerization. A key feature of this process is that it employs the use of a twin-screw extruder as a reactor. The twin-screw extruder conveys the polymer and continuously creates a fresh surface area that facilitates penetration of the depolymerizing agent into the polymer. This research could play a role in reducing the considerable amount of bottle-grade PET resin that is manufactured from virgin materials, resulting in a significant environmental and economic impact. Results of glycolysis experiments on a Leistritz 34 mm counter-rotating twin-screw extruder have been characterized by substantially faster depolymerization rates than typical batch glycolysis reactions, shortening reaction times from hours to minutes. Oligomers with number-average degrees of polymerization (DPn) as low as 13 (Mn = 2,500) can be produced continuously from the starting bottle-grade PET resin (DPn = 102 and Mn = 20,000) in residence times of just 10 minutes. By changing operating conditions, e.g. feed rate and EG:PET ratio, the DPn of the final product can be controlled at essentially atmospheric pressure.},

  abstract = {As molecular electronics advances, efficient and reliable computation procedures are required for the simulation of the atomic structures of actual devices, as well as for the prediction of their electronic properties. Density-functional theory (DFT) has had widespread success throughout chemistry and solid-state physics, and it offers the possibility of fulfilling these roles. In its modern form it is an empirically parameterized approach that cannot be extended toward exact solutions in a prescribed way, ab initio. Thus, it is essential that the weaknesses of the method be identified and likely shortcomings anticipated in advance. We consider four known systematic failures of modern DFT: dispersion, charge transfer, extended {$\pi$} conjugation, and bond cleavage. Their ramifications for molecular electronics applications are outlined and we suggest that great care is required when using modern DFT to partition charge flow across electrode-molecule junctions, screen applied electric fields, position molecular orbitals with respect to electrode Fermi energies, and in evaluating the distance dependence of through-molecule conductivity. The causes of these difficulties are traced to errors inherent in the types of density functionals in common use, associated with their inability to treat very long-range electron correlation effects. Heuristic enhancements of modern DFT designed to eliminate individual problems are outlined, as are three new schemes that each represent significant departures from modern DFT implementations designed to provide a priori improvements in at least one and possible all problem areas. Finally, fully semiempirical schemes based on both Hartree-Fock and Kohn-Sham theory are described that, in the short term, offer the means to avoid the inherent problems of modern DFT and, in the long term, offer competitive accuracy at dramatically reduced computational costs.},

Transesterification reaction of diethylterephthalate with ethanol is investigated as a model system by using the B3LYP level of theory, and Sb(OEt)3, Ge(OEt)4 and Ti(OEt)4 are adopted as model catalysts. We found that the metal center of metal alkoxides coordinates to the carbonyl oxygen atom of the ester, and the alkoxy oxygen atom of alkoxy ligands attacks to the carbonyl carbon atom of the ester to form the four-centered transition state. The activation energy for tetraethoxy titanium catalyzed reaction in vacuo is 15.47 kcal/mol; this is comparable to the experimental result of 11.2 kcal/mol for poly(butylene terephthalate)/Ti(OBu) 4. Because the other mechanisms gave much higher activation energies, this is the most convincing mechanism of PET polycondensation catalysis by antimony, germanium and titanium alkoxides. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {We carried out a theor. study on the mechanism of the thermal degrdn. reaction of polyesters by using the B3LYP level of theory. {$\beta$} elimination reaction of ethylene-, propylene-1,3-, and butylene-1,4-dibenzoates are investigated as model systems for poly(ethylene terephthalate), poly(propylene terephthalate) and poly(butylene terephthalate), resp. Catalysis mechanism of Sb(OEt)3, Ge(OEt)4, Ti(OEt)4 and Zn(OAc)2 is also investigated. Although the catalysis mechanism in {$\beta$} elimination reaction is generally thought to be electron-withdrawing effect of a Lewis acidity of metal center, the activation energies in this mechanism was calcd. to be very similar to those in non-catalyzed reactions and no catalytic effect was obsd. We found that {$\beta$} hydrogen abstraction by the alkoxy ligand of catalyst is more favorable reaction path; the activation energy for non-catalyzed thermal degrdn. reaction of ethylene dibenzoate in vacuo is 51.1 kcal/mol, whereas that in alkoxy ligand mechanism is 43.8 kcal/mol.

  abstract = {In recent years, the use of machine learning (ML) in computational chemistry has enabled numerous advances previously out of reach due to the computational complexity of traditional electronic-structure methods. One of the most promising applications is the construction of ML-based force fields (FFs), with the aim to narrow the gap between the accuracy of ab initio methods and the efficiency of classical FFs. The key idea is to learn the statistical relation between chemical structure and potential energy without relying on a preconceived notion of fixed chemical bonds or knowledge about the relevant interactions. Such universal ML approximations are in principle only limited by the quality and quantity of the reference data used to train them. This review gives an overview of applications of ML-FFs and the chemical insights that can be obtained from them. The core concepts underlying ML-FFs are described in detail, and a step-by-step guide for constructing and testing them from scratch is given. The text concludes with a discussion of the challenges that remain to be overcome by the next generation of ML-FFs.},

  abstract = {The kinetics of polyesterification of the glycolyzed PET waste with adipic acid is reported. Glycolysis of PET waste was carried out with ethylene glycol at three different ratios of PET waste to glycol. The glycolyzed products could be readily polyesterified by reacting with adipic acid, to give polyester polyols with low acid number. Kinetics of polyesterification of the glycolyzed product made from 62.5\% ethylene glycol (EG) and 37.5\% waste were investigated further at different hydroxyl to carboxyl ratios. Reaction conditions were nonisothermal, comparable to the industrial process scheme consisting of two isothermal regions at 170\textdegree{} and 200\textdegree C. The kinetic results of the polyesterification of glycolyzed PET waste are compared to the polyesterification of pure diols, namely ethylene glycol and bis(hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) with adipic acid. The reactions follow second-order kinetics at 170\textdegree C and the rate of polyesterification of the mixed diol system from PET waste lies intermediate between those of the pure diols, namely, EG and BHET. Ethylene glycol exhibited the highest reactivity. At 200\textdegree C the kinetic plots of the mixed diols from PET waste were nonlinear, and thus the reaction may not follow second-order kinetics. The nonlinearity is explained in terms of the different reactivities of the different diol species in the reaction mixture. The polyester polyols, when cured with polymeric 4,4 diphenyl methane diisocyanates, gave polyurethane rigid foams and elastomers. Copyright \textcopyright{} 1988 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

Their theoretical description requires highly accurate quantum chemical calculations, which are computationally expensive. In this review, we focus on not only how machine learning is employed to speed up such excited-state simulations but also how this branch of artificial intelligence can be used to advance this exciting research field in all its aspects. Discussed applications of machine learning for excited states include excited-state dynamics simulations, static calculations of absorption spectra, as well as many others. In order to put these studies into context, we discuss the promises and pitfalls of the involved machine learning techniques. Since the latter are mostly based on quantum chemistry calculations, we also provide a short introduction into excited-state electronic structure methods and approaches for nonadiabatic dynamics simulations and describe tricks and problems when using them in machine learning for excited states of molecules.},

  abstract = {We report a global-hybrid approximation, MN15, to the exchange\textendash correlation functional of Kohn\textendash Sham theory with broadly accurate performance for both multi-reference and single-reference systems.           ,                             Kohn\textendash Sham density functionals are widely used; however, no currently available exchange\textendash correlation functional can predict all chemical properties with chemical accuracy. Here we report a new functional, called MN15, that has broader accuracy than any previously available one. The properties considered in the parameterization include bond energies, atomization energies, ionization potentials, electron affinities, proton affinities, reaction barrier heights, noncovalent interactions, hydrocarbon thermochemistry, isomerization energies, electronic excitation energies, absolute atomic energies, and molecular structures. When compared with 82 other density functionals that have been defined in the literature, MN15 gives the second smallest mean unsigned error (MUE) for 54 data on inherently multiconfigurational systems, the smallest MUE for 313 single-reference chemical data, and the smallest MUE on 87 noncovalent data, with MUEs for these three categories of 4.75, 1.85, and 0.25 kcal mol               -1               , respectively, as compared to the average MUEs of the other 82 functionals of 14.0, 4.63, and 1.98 kcal mol               -1               . The MUE for 17 absolute atomic energies is 7.4 kcal mol               -1               as compared to an average MUE of the other 82 functionals of 34.6 kcal mol               -1               . We further tested MN15 for 10 transition-metal coordination energies, the entire S66x8 database of noncovalent interactions, 21 transition-metal reaction barrier heights, 69 electronic excitation energies of organic molecules, 31 semiconductor band gaps, seven transition-metal dimer bond lengths, and 193 bond lengths of 47 organic molecules. The MN15 functional not only performs very well for our training set, which has 481 pieces of data, but also performs very well for our test set, which has 823 data that are not in our training set. The test set includes both ground-state properties and molecular excitation energies. For the latter MN15 achieves simultaneous accuracy for both valence and Rydberg electronic excitations when used with linear-response time-dependent density functional theory, with an MUE of less than 0.3 eV for both types of excitations.},

  abstract = {The computerized optimized code enables Multiwfn to carry out large scale electronstatic potential analyses for systems of considerable size.           ,              The evaluation of molecular electrostatic potential (ESP) is a performance bottleneck for many computational chemical tasks like restrained ESP charge fitting or quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics simulations. In this paper, an efficient algorithm for the evaluation of ESP is proposed. It regroups the expression in terms of primitive Gaussian type orbitals (GTOs) with identical angular momentum types and nuclei centers. Each term is calculated using a computerized optimized code. This algorithm was integrated into the wavefunction analysis program Multiwfn and was tested on several large systems. In the cases of dopamine and remdesivir, the performance of this algorithm was comparable to or better than some popular state-of-the-art codes. For meta1\textendash organic framework-5, where the number of GTOs and ESP points is 4840 and 259\,262, respectively, our code could finish the evaluation in 1874 seconds on ordinary hardware. It also exhibits good parallelization scaling. The source code of this algorithm is freely available and can become a useful tool for computational chemists.},
